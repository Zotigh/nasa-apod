> As someone interested in astronomy and space exploration, I want to view the current day's APOD, and those from other days as well.

### Economical Android user

> As a user who doesn't have unlimited bandwidth and storage, I need to be able to keep some images locally, and delete others.

### Media consumer

> As someone who enjoys using images from the Internet as wallpaper, screen savers, etc., I want to be able to download high-resolution versions of the APOD images.
